# Facebook Safe Unfollow Script

A safe, rate-limit-aware JavaScript script for bulk unfollowing on Facebook. This script is designed to avoid detection and account restrictions by using human-like timing patterns and conservative batch processing.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

**Use at your own risk.** This script:

- May violate Facebook's Terms of Service
- Could result in account restrictions or bans
- Is provided for educational purposes only
- Should be used responsibly and sparingly

## ‚ú® Features

- **Rate-limit safe**: Conservative delays and batch processing
- **Human-like behavior**: Random timing and long breaks
- **Auto-navigation**: Attempts to navigate to the correct Following page
- **Emergency stop**: Red stop button for immediate halt
- **Detailed logging**: Shows progress and debugging information
- **Profile detection**: Tries to identify who is being unfollowed

## üöÄ How to Use

### Prerequisites

- You must be logged into Facebook
- Navigate to your Facebook profile
- Ensure you can see your Following list

### Method 1: Browser Console (Recommended)

1. **Open your Facebook profile** in a web browser
2. **Open Developer Tools** (F12 or right-click ‚Üí Inspect)
3. **Go to the Console tab**
4. **Copy and paste** the entire script from `facebook-unfollow.js`
5. **Press Enter** to run the script

### Method 2: Browser Bookmarklet

1. **Copy the bookmarklet code** from `bookmarklet.js`
2. **Create a new bookmark** in your browser
3. **Paste the code as the URL** (keep the `javascript:` prefix)
4. **Navigate to your Facebook Following page**
5. **Click the bookmark** to run the script

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The script includes several safety settings that can be adjusted:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  minDelay: 4000, // Minimum 4 seconds between actions
  maxDelay: 10000, // Maximum 10 seconds between actions
  batchSize: 1, // Process 1 profile at a time
  batchBreak: 30000, // 30 second break between each
  maxActions: 10, // Stop after 10 unfollows (very safe)
  scrollDelay: 5000, // Wait 5 seconds after scrolling
  maxScrollAttempts: 10, // Maximum scroll attempts to load content
};
```

### Making it More/Less Conservative

**More Conservative** (safer):

- Increase `minDelay` and `maxDelay`
- Decrease `maxActions`
- Increase `batchBreak`
- Run less frequently (once per day maximum)

**Less Conservative** (higher risk):

- Decrease delays (not recommended)
- Increase `maxActions` (maximum 50 recommended)
- **Never remove the breaks entirely**

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- **Emergency Stop Button**: Red button appears on page for immediate halt
- **Page Detection**: Verifies you're on the correct Following page
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays to avoid triggering Facebook's anti-bot measures
- **Error Handling**: Graceful recovery from unexpected issues
- **Conservative Defaults**: Safe settings out of the box

## üìä What to Expect

When running successfully, you'll see output like:

```
üîç Checking current page...
‚úÖ On Following page, proceeding...
üöÄ Starting Facebook unfollow process...
üìÑ Loading content...
üîç Found 3 "Following" buttons
üë§ Unfollowing: John Doe
‚úÖ Successfully unfollowed 1/10
‚è≥ Waiting 6 seconds before next action...
‚è∏Ô∏è Taking break (30s)...
```

## üö® Warning Signs

**Stop immediately if you see:**

- Facebook asking you to verify your identity
- Any security warnings or captchas
- "Action Blocked" messages
- Unusual behavior (buttons not responding)

If you encounter any of these, wait at least 24 hours before trying again.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "No Following buttons found"

- Make sure you're on the Following page, not Followers
- Try scrolling down manually to load profiles
- Refresh the page and try again
- Check if Facebook has changed their layout

### Script clicking wrong elements

- Facebook frequently changes their structure
- The script may need updates for new layouts
- Try refreshing and running again

### Account warnings or restrictions

- Stop using the script immediately
- Wait at least 24-48 hours
- Consider manual unfollowing instead
